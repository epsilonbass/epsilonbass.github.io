                <p>Since a young age I've always had a passion to create and perform. I joined a band in high school
                and began teaching myself photoshop, flash, and html so I could create band fliers, album art work,
                websites, and merchandise. I explored different mediums throughout my education from performance
                arts and photography to web building and illustration.

                At The University of the Arts my horizons were expanded and my interests turned towards film. I studied film and digital video under a variety of professors whose distinct styles gave me a wide arsenal of film knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since college I have worked with a multitude of different clients from directing music videos and concert series, assisting with edits for feature films, and crafting unique work for businesses to connect with their audience. I currently enjoy the vastly changing world of social media and the impact that video plays. I enjoy seeing how communities are more able to interact with the content that they love and how video plays a role in providing new experiences.  </p>
